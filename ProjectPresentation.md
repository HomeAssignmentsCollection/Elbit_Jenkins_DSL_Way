# ðŸš€ Project Presentation: CI/CD + DevSecOps Platform

## Project Goal
Build a modern, secure, and observable CI/CD platform for containerized applications using Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and KEDA, following best DevSecOps practices.

---

## Architecture Overview
- **User â†’ Nginx (reverse proxy) â†’ Flask API**
- All services are containerized (Docker)
- Deployment in Kubernetes (minikube/dev/prod)
- Automation via Jenkins (Job DSL) and scripts
- Autoscaling via KEDA

---

## Key Technologies
- **Jenkins + Job DSL**: Automated CI/CD pipelines
- **Docker**: Multi-stage, secure container builds
- **Flask API**: Python microservice, Docker SDK integration
- **Nginx**: Reverse proxy, security headers
- **Kubernetes**: Orchestration, RBAC, NetworkPolicy, resource quotas
- **KEDA**: Event-driven autoscaling
- **Prometheus + Grafana**: Monitoring & alerting
- **EFK/Opensearch**: Centralized logging
- **Jaeger/Tempo**: Distributed tracing

---

## DevSecOps & Security Best Practices
- Non-root containers, drop capabilities, read-only rootfs
- RBAC, NetworkPolicy, namespace isolation
- ConfigMap and Secrets for configuration
- Admission control (OPA/Kyverno â€” recommended)
- Image scanning (Trivy, Dockle â€” recommended)
- Health endpoints, probes, graceful degradation

---

## CI/CD Pipeline
- Jenkins Seed Job generates pipelines:
  - build-flask-api (Docker build/push)
  - build-nginx-proxy (Docker build/push)
  - runner-job (local integration test)
- Checks: lint, tests, security scan
- Deployment to Kubernetes via kubectl/Helm

---

## Observability
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager
- **Logging**: EFK/Opensearch, structured logs, alerts
- **Tracing**: Jaeger/Tempo, request correlation

---

## Disaster Recovery & Runbooks
- Backup/restore: PVC, etcd, images, configs
- Rollback: kubectl rollout undo, Helm rollback
- Troubleshooting: kubectl logs, describe, events, Prometheus/Grafana

---

## Advantages
- End-to-end automation: build, test, deploy, monitor
- Security by design: least privilege, isolation, scanning
- Observability: metrics, logs, traces, alerts
- Scalability: KEDA-driven autoscaling
- Modular and extensible: easy to adapt for new services

---

## Areas for Improvement
- Advanced secrets management (Vault, etc.)
- More unit/integration tests, API documentation
- Production-grade disaster recovery
- TLS/Ingress, service mesh integration
- Full automation via Terraform
